# iOS Developer Assessment Test Project

This repository contains an iOS project for the iOS Developer Assessment Test. The project uses RxSwift, Alamofire, AlamofireImage, and follows the VIPER architecture pattern. It also includes some unit tests.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system before proceeding:

- Xcode: [Download and install Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- CocoaPods: [Install CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)

## Getting Started

To build and run the project on your iOS device or simulator, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
``git clone https://github.com/heinzawaung-hza/ios_developer_assessment.git``

2. Navigate to the project directory:
``cd ios_developer_assessment/``

3. Install dependencies using CocoaPods:
``pod install``

4. Open the project in Xcode:
``open Din\ Din.xcworkspace/``

5. Select the desired target device or simulator from the Xcode toolbar.

6. Build and run the project by clicking the "Play" button or by pressing `Cmd+R`.


## Third-Party Libraries

The project utilizes several third-party libraries to enhance development efficiency and provide additional functionality:

1. **RxSwift**: A reactive programming library that simplifies handling asynchronous events and data streams, making it easier to implement reactive patterns.

2. **Alamofire**: A networking library that provides a simple and elegant way to make network requests, handle responses, and manage network reachability.

3. **AlamofireImage**: An image component library built on Alamofire that simplifies fetching, caching, and displaying remote images asynchronously.

These libraries were chosen for their functionality, reliability, and widespread adoption in the iOS development community.
